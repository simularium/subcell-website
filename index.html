                    Fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis, cell motility, and cytokinesis are reliant on a cell's ability 
                    to produce force. The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in force production in these processes.

                        There have been many independent efforts to model these properties using different spatial simulation methods that emphasize 
                        different spatiotemporal scales. However, each simulation method has limitations due to its particular implementation and 
                        assumptions characteristic of the simulated length scale.

                    We sought to determine the regimes in which each simulator captured the 3D mechanics of compressing actin
                    filaments. To do this, we simulated the compression of an actin filament at five compression velocities, spanning the
                    range of velocities that were computationally feasible and physiologically relevant.

                        These simulations showed systematic differences in the shapes of these bending and twisting filaments. The filaments 
                        simulated using ReaDDy had notable directional biphasic out-of-plane behavior, indicative of filament twist
                        only captured with monomer-scale resolution. This out-of-plane helical behavior was also more evident in filaments
                        simulated at higher compression velocities. The Cytosim simulations showed very little out-of-plane behavior at any
                        compression velocities, and when they did, it was just as likely to be in either direction.

                Notably, the monomer-scale simulations captured
                an out-of-plane filament twist, characteristic of a helical structure, more effectively than the fiber-scale simulations.

                    Inverse PCA transforms of the filament shapes confirmed that PC1 captured filament compression and peak asymmetry,
                    while PC2 scaled with filament non-coplanarity and twist. Inverse transforms also revealed that low values
                    of PC2 correspond to twist in the opposite direction. Some Cytosim simulations show this behavior, likely because
                    directional helicity is not enforced in Cytosim. Overall, we conclude that compressing filaments simulated at monomer
                    resolution capture directional out-of-plane helicity more than filaments simulated at the fiber scale.
