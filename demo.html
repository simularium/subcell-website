                        The dynamic bending and twisting of actin filaments mechanically drive many processes in cells.

                    <p>
                        Fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis, cell motility, and cytokinesis are reliant on a cell's ability
                        to produce force. The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in force production in these processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The helical structure of actin filaments results in the coupling of filament twisting and bending,
                        which impacts the structure of the actin network in 3D space.
                        This has implications for actin's function in force production and maintainance of subcellular structures.

                        Many different simulation methods have been developed to model actin.
                        Each simulation method has limitations depending on the spatial scale.

                        ReaDDy Actin filaments are composed of particles, one for each actin monomer, which are held together by potentials.

                        Cytosim actin filaments are represented by control points that define a mathematical line, which is acted upon by physical forces.

                        We wanted to know how each simulator captured structural properties of actin in different situations.

                        ReaDDy actin filaments showed high non-coplanarity in one direction, especially in filaments simulated at higher compression velocities.
                        Cytosim filaments showed very little out-of-plane behavior at any compression velocities, and when they did, it was just as likely to be in either direction.

                    <p>
                        Inverse PCA transforms of the filament shapes confirmed that PC1 captured filament compression and peak asymmetry, while PC2 scaled with filament non-coplanarity and twist. Inverse transforms also revealed that low values of PC2 correspond to twist in the opposite direction. Some Cytosim simulations show this behavior, likely because directional helicity is not enforced in Cytosim.
